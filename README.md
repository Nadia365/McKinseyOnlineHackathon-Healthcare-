Here, the original problem statement is copied from "ttps://datahack.analyticsvidhya.com/contest/mckinsey-analytics-online-hackathon/":

"In this case, your client wants to have study around one of the critical disease "Stroke". Stroke is a disease that affects the arteries leading to and within the brain. A stroke occurs when a blood vessel that carries oxygen and nutrients to the brain is either blocked by a clot or bursts (or ruptures). When that happens, part of the brain cannot get the blood (and oxygen) it needs, so it and brain cells die.

Over the last few years, the Client has captured several health, demographic and lifestyle details about its patients. This includes details such as age and gender, along with several health parameters (e.g. hypertension, body mass index) and lifestyle related variables (e.g. smoking status, occupation type).

The Client wants you to predict the probability of stroke happening to their patients. This will help doctors take proactive health measures for these patients."
We are provided with:

- train dataset (will be used to train your model)

- test dataset (Submit predictions for the records in test dataset)

- sample submission (CSV Format for making a submission at the platform)
The objective is to try and make the best model using train data, make predictions for the test set, and submit in the CSV format for sample submission using AUC ROC score as a criterion of the evaluation metric for predictability.
